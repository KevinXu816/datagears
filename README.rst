Large-scale data processing and inference engine for machine learning.


Features
--------

Expresive library to design fast executable graphs for all stages of machine learning process:
    (1) **Data exploration phase:** Build reproducible on-the-fly data exploration and processing graphs with full parallelism support
    (2) **Training phase:** Use processing graphs as data generators. 
    (3) **Inference phase:** Deploy processing graphs to production environments for efficient and fast inferences with support for monitoring of model degradation.
